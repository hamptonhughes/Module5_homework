# Module5_homework - Pymaceuticals


## Description 
    This project analyzes a study that was conducted on mice to determine which
    drug regimen yielded the greatest reduction in tumor size over time.
    
    I have used Jupyter notebooks to read in two csv files, which you will find in the Pymaceutical folders.  Within the notebook, you will find various analysis, summaries, charts of the data
    
##Instructions
    Once a chart has been plotted, press the power button in the top right of the chart to avoid charts plotting on top of each other.  The one exception is the final linear regression chart.
